<p>We see a Navbar, This is a Responsive Navbar and changes its background color whenever we scroll down the web page.</p>
<p>Then we find the Heading section. Here we have an intro and a proposal site navigation.</p>

<p>After entering the login section by Clicking from Navbar or the proposal nav, we'll find login options as below. </p>

<p>Here we'll be asked by which method we want to enter. Notice, only a shopkeeper can login or sign up here by a mobile number. General customers will login or sign up with an email address.</p>
<p>If a shopkeeper wants to login or create and shopkeeper account, he will go through the 'Continue with Mobile Number'. But when a customer wants to login or sign up, he'll go through 'Continue with Email'. Then he'll see this form as following :</p>

<p>Here a customer can login to this site with his email and password if he already has an account. If not, he can create one by clicking 'create here'. If he want to create an account, he will be asked as below : </p>

<p>Similarly a shopkeeper can also login with his phone number and password. If he want to create a shopkeeper account, he'll go through the 'Continue with Number' option when he was asked after going to the login option page and then he'll be asked his credentials in a different form rather than a customer's form as following :</p>
